Solution Approach :

As per the given constraints I have taken time as a universal variable such that if t = 0 is the starting time then t = Tr is the time when the last vehicle reaches sits final destination city. Also I have assumed another condition that for every vehicle I am charging that amount of battery with which it covers the distance for the another node. Also by taking time this manner and also observing the nodes of every vehicle I can get maximum value of Tr is as minimum as possible.

So for the given constraints I have assumed it as a 2 linear equations :

1. y = mx + c
where,
  y = total charge
  m = charging rate(Cr)
  x = time taken
  c = initial charge(Br)

2. y' = m'x'

So net charge is the result of equation 1 and 2.
And by given average speed (constant for all the cars) we can calculate our required distance.

So the algorithm is as follows :

1.  Defining path_plot function, which uses info of city and vehicle.
2.  Calculating Heuristic of distances in each city
3.  Applying A* algorithm to get the optimal path for the node
4.  Optimisation of charge and time for the optimal path found
5.  Now getting the travel time of each car and reporting the final minimised Tr.

Result obtained :

Path :
[0, 1]
[1, 2]
[2, 0]

Time Taken :
12.0
17.0
16.0

Tr :
17.0
